## Kali Mirror Usage Help

### Address

[https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/kali/](https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/kali/)

### Description

*Kali Linux* software repository.

### Supported System Architectures

amd64, armel, armhf, i386

---

### Usage Instructions

#### Method 1

Edit the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and add the following entries at the top:

```shell
deb https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
deb-src https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
```

#### Method 2
Use the sed command to replace

```shell
sudo sed -i "s@http://http.kali.org/kali@https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/kali@g" /etc/apt/sources.list
```

### Note

> After changing the `sources.list` file, please run `sudo apt-get update` to update the index and apply the changes.

Since the Kali repository does not use the by-hash mechanism, consistency during synchronization cannot be guaranteed. If you run `apt update` during synchronization, you may see an error like this:

```text
E: Failed to fetch https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/kali/dists/kali-rolling/main/source/Sources.gz File has unexpected size (14593053 != 14592993). Mirror sync in progress?
```

If you encounter the above error, you will need to wait for the synchronization to complete before running `apt update` again.
