### Usage Instructions

Pacman prioritizes the servers in the `mirrorlist` based on their order, so to add a mirror, it should be placed at the very top of the file; you may also comment out all other mirrors.

For detailed instructions on using mirrors for Arch Linux, please see the [official documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/mirrors).

Edit `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` and add the following at the very top of the file:

```text
Server = https://mirrors.idc.daocloud.io/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
```

It is also recommended to enable the `archlinuxcn` repository. For information about the `archlinuxcn` repository, please check [archlinuxcn Mirror Usage Help](#/doc/archlinuxcn).

### Note

After modifying the `mirrorlist`, please update the package cache:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

Using two `y` flags helps to avoid problems when switching from a corrupted mirror to a working one.

If you switch from a newer mirror to an older one, the following command can be used to downgrade certain packages to prevent partial system updates:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyuu
```
