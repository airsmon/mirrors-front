title: Notification Regarding the End of Life for CentOS
name: centos_EOL

The CentOS public mirrors provided by our mirror site are sourced from the official CentOS. Once CentOS ceases maintenance, we will also discontinue support for the operating system, no longer providing software updates and security patches. To avoid the impact of the operating system's end of life (EOL), users of any version of CentOS are advised to take appropriate measures before the EOL to continue receiving software updates and security patches. This document primarily introduces the response strategies for the end of CentOS operating system maintenance.

## Background Information
On December 8, 2020, the CentOS official announced plans to cease maintenance of CentOS and introduced the CentOS Stream project. For more information, please refer to the [CentOS Official Announcement](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) and [FAQ](https://centos.org/distro-faq/).

CentOS 6 reached EOL on November 30, 2020, and CentOS 8 on December 31, 2021. We have simultaneously ceased support for these operating systems.

CentOS 7 will reach EOL on **June 30, 2024**, at which time support for the operating system will also cease. We will reserve a six-month cache period until **Jan 31, 2025** to assist you with the transition. After the transition period, we will remove the mirrors. To avoid the impact of the operating system's EOL, it is recommended that you take appropriate response strategies before the EOL.

## Alternative Operating Systems to CentOS

### Operating Systems Binary Compatible with CentOS

> Binary compatibility refers to the ability of an operating system to run compiled applications and software from another operating system without the need to recompile the program code. This means that when redeploying the environment, there is no need to recompile applications and software due to changes in interfaces, saving time and resources, but it does not guarantee compatibility of bugs.

## Continuing to Use CentOS

If you need to continue using CentOS due to business requirements and require the use of certain installation packages within the CentOS system, you will need to switch the source of the operating system.
